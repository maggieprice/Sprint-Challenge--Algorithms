## Exercise I

a) I think the runtime for this problem is: O(n)
I think this because:
Each time the problem is ran, the same amount gets added each time. So, when I look at the graph on the iterative sorting page in the TK, n goes up one and over one each time creating a linear "curve". In my example where n = 5, the points are (a, a+n^3) (0, 25), (25, 50), (50, 75), (75, 100), and (100, 125). I get a linear line when I plot them.
Here is a repl.it I created to work out the problem visually. I gave n a value of 5 and printed a. https://repl.it/@maggieprice/GenuineThirdProcessor
